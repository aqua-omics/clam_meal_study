This study was conducted to determine how the health, fatty acid profiles, gut microbiome, and growth of Florida pompano juveniles change in response to feeds with varying percentages of clam meal in their feed. Gut samples were taken at the end of the experiment. Extracted DNA samples were sent to GeneWiz (South Plainfield, NJ, USA) for 16S EZ sequencing to amplify the bacterial/archaeal 16S V3V4 region using the proprietary primers. The primary goal of this study was to determine if the juveniles would benefit or at least not have negative effects to increasing percentages clam meal replacing fish meal. This would provide a more sustainable source of protein than fish meal for finfish aquaculture.
